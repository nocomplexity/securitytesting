The core philosophy of this open course is that every reader, user, and security expert should have a seamless way to contribute to its improvement.

Recognising that our time is a finite resource, I have focused on removing as many barriers to entry as possible.

To ensure the contribution process is straightforward, the source material is written in Markdown, and the course curriculum is built using the excellent [Jupyter Book toolchain](https://jupyterbook.org/).

All contributors will be formally acknowledged in subsequent editions and updates.

We appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.
