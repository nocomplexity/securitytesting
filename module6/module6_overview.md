In this module, you will learn how to identify common Python vulnerabilities using Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

The following subsections are covered:

* **Frequently found weaknesses**

  * Injection attacks
  * Insecure deserialisation
  * Path traversal

* **Insecure AI coding patterns**

By the end of this section, you will be able to recognise common security weaknesses in Python applications and assess their potential impact with greater confidence.
