# Mastering Security Testing for Python Applications


## Introduction

> [!TIP]
>  Standard Security Testing Isn't Enough for Python. 
> Gain a deep understanding of the methodologies and specialized tools used to conduct professional-grade security validation for Python applications.



Generic security testing often fails to uncover the unique risks inherent in Python environments. While many testers are proficient in broad security principles, few possess the specialised insight into Python’s nuances required for truly effective assessments. **Mastering Security Testing for Python** provides the deep-dive expertise you need to secure modern applications with confidence.


## Goal of this course

> [!NOTE]
> The aim of this course is to teach you how to carry out security testing on Python programs. You do not need a strong background in Python programming to take this course.



This course is designed for developers and security enthusiasts, taking you from basic code hygiene through to advanced automated security analysis. It focuses on reliable open-source security tools to identify vulnerabilities arising from Python’s dynamic nature and the common pitfalls in its ecosystem.


> [!CAUTION]
> **This course assumes a basic familiarity with Python syntax and the command line.**


It is designed to take you from a security novice to a proficient code auditor. Rather than focusing solely on theory, we will take a practical approach—identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in **Python code** using **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** tools.


## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for software security testers who want to improve their knowledge and skills in security testing for Python software.

It is also suitable for DevOps professionals, architects, security professionals, AppSec engineers, software engineers, web application developers, and others interested in learning about security testing for Python software.

The course focuses on practical steps that can be taken — even with limited resources — to build your skills in security testing for Python software and performing security audits on systems that include Python components.
This is not a beginner’s course that simply teaches you to run tools and follow a checklist.
To get the most from this course (and to complete it successfully), you should already be familiar with:

- software testing
- using programs from the command-line interface (CLI) on Unix-like systems (Linux or BSD)

> [!TIP]
> Some prior knowledge and experience with security testing is strongly recommended.

> [!NOTE]
> This course is **not** a beginner’s course, but aims to **deepen the knowledge of professional security testers** in relation to systems built with (or containing) Python code.
