Before starting any Python security assessment, it is essential to establish a controlled, secure, and well-documented testing environment. The quality of your environment directly influences the reliability, credibility, and reproducibility of your findings.

This module provides an overview of the key elements required to properly set up your test environment. The following topics are covered in this module:

* **Secure test environment**: Outlines principles of isolation, system hardening, and safe configuration.
* **Secure testing for Python**: Teaches specific security considerations when assessing Python applications and their dependencies.
* **Reproducibility** : Ensuring your setup and results can be repeated and verified.
* **Securing your findings** : Protecting sensitive test results and maintaining professional reporting standards.
* **Installation of test tools** : Secure and controlled installation practices for Python security tools.

Together, these topics form the foundation for conducting structured, responsible, and professional Python security testing.
