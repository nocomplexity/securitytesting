title: Testing to Identify Python Security Risks
short_title: Core of testing
---


Security testing is a structured approach to:

1. Gaining insight into relevant security risks
2. Reducing those risks through appropriate mitigation measures

Mitigation measures may include code changes, architectural improvements, process adjustments, or environmental controls designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents.

At its core, security testing is about risk mitigation. It is not merely a technical exercise; it is a business-critical activity aimed at protecting organisational assets, reputation, and continuity.

Mitigating cyber security risks is inherently complex. It involves multiple areas of the organisation and requires collaboration between different stakeholders, including developers, security specialists, management, legal teams, and operational staff.

:class: note
Security testing for Python code is the process of identifying vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and risks in scripts or applications before they can be exploited by a malicious actor. Because Python is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and infrastructure tooling, it comes with a recognisable set of common security pitfalls.

Understanding cyber security requires both technical depth and business awareness. You must be able to:

* Understand the underlying technologies, systems, services, and dependencies in use
* Recognise how technical weaknesses translate into business risks
* Evaluate contractual, regulatory, and operational implications

For non-technical stakeholders, the technological aspects can be difficult to grasp without years of education and experience. Conversely, understanding business processes, strategic priorities, and risk tolerance requires a different set of skills and expertise.

Effective security testing therefore sits at the intersection of technology and business. It requires professionals who can translate technical findings into meaningful risk statements and actionable mitigation strategies aligned with organisational objectives.
