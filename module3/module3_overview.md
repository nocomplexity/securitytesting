## Overview

In this section, we will explore:

- [Pareto Principle for Python Security](pareto):
Learn how a small number of recurring design flaws and coding weaknesses cause most security issues in Python applications. This section shows you where to focus your efforts to achieve maximum security impact with minimal effort.

+++

- [SAST for Python:](foundation_of_sast)
Understand how Static Application Security Testing (SAST) helps detect common vulnerabilities directly in Python source code. You will learn how SAST works, its strengths and limitations, and how to integrate it effectively into your development workflow.

+++

- [Human in the Loop](human_in_the_loop):
Automation is essential, but not sufficient. This section highlights the critical role of human expertise in reviewing architecture, design decisions, and business logic to achieve a comprehensive security assessment.


By the end of this section, you will understand why focusing on the most critical Python security flaws is vital and most effective. You will also learn what SAST for Python is, its advantages, and how to combine automation with expert review to catch vulnerabilities that tools alone cannot find.
