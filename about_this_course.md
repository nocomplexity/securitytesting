# About this course

I created this course to share valuable insights and techniques to make security testing for Python applications more effective, engaging, and impactful.

As one of the world’s most widely used programming languages, Python powers critical infrastructure globally and serves as the primary engine for advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

While developing the Free and Open Source (FOSS) SAST scanner, Python Code Audit, I discovered a significant gap in the market. Most freely available resources fail to cover the essential concepts required for high-quality security testing in Python-based systems.

There are many myths surrounding security and its perceived complexity. The reality is more nuanced: some of those myths are, unfortunately, true. However, I believe openness is the solution. Continuous education and proactive awareness are fundamental to demystifying and simplifying cybersecurity.

Perhaps the most challenging aspect of security is trust. While trust is often essential—as no single individual can master every technical layer and business process—it can also be a liability. Technology has become too complex to rely on intuition alone.

My philosophy is simple: never assume; always verify. Proactively identifying weaknesses in Python software before they evolve into exploitable vulnerabilities is not just best practice—it is a necessity.
