# The Strategic Advantages of FOSS in Security


## Why Use FOSS Tools for Security Testing

Transparency and openness help to increase security levels. However, there is still considerable resistance to using open-source software in business environments, particularly when it comes to security and privacy functionality. This concern is often unnecessary, as FOSS security testing tools for Python frequently outperform commercial testing software in many areas.

Some core benefits of using FOSS software for security testing of Python code include:

* **Higher-quality software**
* **The ability to safely leverage open-source technologies**
* **Improved security**
* **Flexibility:** You can adapt and tailor the software to meet your exact requirements.
* **Cost efficiency:** FOSS software does not require annual licence subscriptions. However, as with commercial software, you can obtain an SLA (Service Level Agreement) based on your needs.
* **Reduced vendor lock-in:** Most mature Python security testing tools are supported by multiple organisations or communities rather than a single company.
* **Easier access to expertise and resources:** Some specialist security testing tools require in-depth knowledge and experience. Many FOSS Python security tools are widely adopted, making expertise more readily available when required.

:::{warning}
Ensure that the software you use is genuinely open source and distributed under a valid OSI-approved FOSS licence. Avoid tools that claim to be open source in name only.

Always consider supporting the developers or foundation behind the product. This may include contributing improvements (code or documentation) and providing financial support to help ensure the long-term sustainability and health of the FOSS project.
