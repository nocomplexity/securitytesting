# The Strategic Advantages of FOSS in Security


## Why Use FOSS Tools for Security Testing

Transparency and openness help to increase security levels. However, there is still considerable resistance to using open-source software in business environments, particularly when it comes to security and privacy functionality. This concern is often unnecessary, as FOSS security testing tools for Python frequently outperform commercial testing software in many areas.

Some core benefits of using FOSS software for security testing of Python code include:

* **Higher-quality software**
* **The ability to safely leverage open-source technologies**
* **Improved security**
* **Flexibility:** You can adapt and tailor the software to meet your exact requirements.
* **Cost efficiency:** FOSS software does not require annual licence subscriptions. However, as with commercial software, you can obtain an SLA (Service Level Agreement) based on your needs.
* **Reduced vendor lock-in:** Most mature Python security testing tools are supported by multiple organisations or communities rather than a single company.
* **Easier access to expertise and resources:** Some specialist security testing tools require in-depth knowledge and experience. Many FOSS Python security tools are widely adopted, making expertise more readily available when required.

Ensure that the test software you use for security testing is genuinely open source and distributed under a valid [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/) FOSS licence. Avoid using tools that claim to be open source in name only. 
:::

Open source in name only" (often called OSINO or Openwashing) refers to software that uses the "open source" label for marketing but fails to provide the actual freedoms associated with it—such as the right to modify, redistribute, or use the code without restrictive commercial licenses. Some disadvantages are:
1. Vendor Lock-In and False Autonomy
While these tools appear to give you control, they often include "poison pill" clauses or proprietary dependencies. If the vendor changes their pricing, goes bust, or stops supporting the product, you are left with a codebase you cannot legally or practically maintain yourself. You lose the primary benefit of true open source: the ability to "fork" the code and carry on independently.
2. Sharing e.g. rules for SAST scanning is not allowed or not possible.
3. The test software itself is not secure and can cause security vulnerabilities.

Always consider supporting the developers or foundation behind the product. This may include contributing improvements (code or documentation) and providing financial support to help ensure the long-term sustainability and health of the FOSS project.
