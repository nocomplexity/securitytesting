This module explores tool categories, their strengths, and weaknesses, and decision-making frameworks for SAST, DAST, IAST, dependency scanning, and related testing approaches.


Effective security testing is not about using as many tools as possible — it is about using the *right tool for the right test*. Each security testing approach serves a distinct purpose within the software development lifecycle. Understanding when and how to apply different techniques is essential for achieving meaningful and reliable results.

In this section, we will explore:

* **Using the right tool for the right test** – Understanding the differences between testing approaches such as SAST, DAST and dependency analysis, and when each should be applied.
* **The strategic advantages of FOSS in security** – Why Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) plays a crucial role in transparent, trustworthy and sustainable security testing.
* **Tool selection checklist** – Practical criteria for evaluating and selecting Python security testing tools that meet quality, openness and operational requirements.
* **Security testing and AI** – The role of AI and machine learning in modern security testing, including their benefits, limitations and implications for reproducibility.

By the end of this section, you will be able to make informed decisions about security tooling, understand the strategic value of open-source solutions, and critically assess where emerging AI technologies fit into a robust Python security testing strategy.
