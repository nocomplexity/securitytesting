# Why Use Checklists for validation


Security validation benefits from structure and consistency. Checklists reduce subjectivity and ensure that critical aspects are not overlooked.

In this section, you will explore why structured validation frameworks improve assurance and how they support both technical and organisational security objectives.

Before discussing checklists, it is important to clarify what *validation* means in the context of security testing.

In this course, **validation does not mean executing tests against code**. 

Instead, validation refers to the structured verification that security requirements, controls, assumptions, and configurations are correct, complete, and appropriately defined. It is about confirming that security has been properly considered and implemented at a design, configuration, and process level—before any technical testing begins.

Validation may include:

* Confirming that security requirements are clearly defined
* Verifying that authentication and authorisation models are documented
* Ensuring input validation rules are specified
* Checking that secrets management policies are in place
* Reviewing dependency management and update policies
* Confirming secure configuration baselines are defined

In other words, validation asks: *Have we designed and configured this system securely?*
**It is preventative rather than reactive.**



Cyber security checklists are essential for minimising risk. When structured clearly and used consistently, they help prevent costly and avoidable security errors. Rather than relying on memory or experience alone, security professionals can follow a systematic process that ensures critical validation steps are never missed.

In many mature professions, checklists are mandatory tools for reducing the likelihood of disaster. In aviation, for example, pilots rely on strict pre-flight and emergency checklists before every take-off. In medical surgery, teams use procedural checklists to avoid life-threatening mistakes. Engineering disciplines—including the automotive and rail industries—depend on formal validation procedures to prevent catastrophic failure.

Security validation for Python systems deserves the same level of discipline. A checklist:

* Promotes consistency across projects and teams
* Reduces reliance on memory
* Helps identify gaps in requirements and design
* Encourages repeatable and auditable security processes
* Supports compliance and governance requirements

Most importantly, **a checklist transforms security from an informal consideration into a controlled and professional practice**. It ensures that validation is deliberate, structured, and reliable—rather than left to assumption or chance.
